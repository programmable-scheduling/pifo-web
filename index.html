     The Push-In First-Out Queue (PIFO) is a priority queue data structure that allows
     packets to be "pushed" (enqueued) into an arbitrary location in the queue, but only
     dequeued from the head. PIFOs enable programmable packet scheduling: by programming
     how each packet's location in the PIFO is computed as it arrives, PIFOs allow network
     operators to express a wide variety of practical schedulers. Further, PIFOs are feasible
     in hardware at the high clock rates (1 GHz) typical of high-end switches today.

<dt><p>What motivated this work?</p></dt>
<dd><p>
Today's switch schedulers are fixed. As an operator, beyond tweaking a few
parameters in an existing scheduling algorithm, there is no way to express a
new scheduling algorithm once a switch has been built.
</p>

<p>
This capability to program a switch is useful in many ways. It allows network
operators to customize their network by running specific schedulers for
specific application objectives. For instance, the <a
href="http://web.stanford.edu/~skatti/pubs/sigcomm13-pfabric.pdf">Shortest
Remaining Processing Time scheduler</a> minimizes flow completion times, <a
href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/wi01/cse222/papers/demers-fq-ire90.pdf">Fair
Queueing</a> shares constrained link capacity equitably among contending flows,
and <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~rachit/ups.pdf">least slack time
first</a> minimizes tail packet delays.
</p>

<p>
Yet, despite demonstrating significant
benefits in simulations, these schedulers haven't been realized in practice
because there is no way to modify an existing switch to support a new
scheduler.  PIFOs aim to change that by making the switch scheduler
programmable.
</p></dd>

<dt><p>How do PIFOs work?</p></dt>
<dd><p>
Any scheduling algorithm makes two decisions: in what order packets are
transmitted and when? PIFOs exploit the observation that in many practical
schedulers, these decisions can be made as the packet is enqueued. Put differently,
a packet's place in the scheduling order or its scheduling time can be determined
at enqueue, exploiting the fact that the relative order of already buffered packets
does not need to change.
</p>

<p>An example of this is strict priority scheduling, where each packet has a
priority associated with it. Using this priority, a packet can be enqueued into
its right location in an array that maintains scheduling order. Further,
packets that are already enqueued don't need to be reordered relative to each
other. This sorted array is the PIFO, and a packet's location is determined by
writing a program to compute it every time a packet arrives. This program computing
packet locations is what makes PIFOs programmable.</p>

<p>Now, there are algorithms where the relative order of already buffered packets
does need to change with new packet arrivals. An example is
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hzhang/papers/TON-97-Oct.pdf">Hierarchical Packet Fair
Queueing</a> (HPFQ), which divides link capacity among classes in some ratio, and then recursively
in some ration between flows within a class, and so on. However, with a minor change
to the PIFO to enqueue either a packet or a pointer to another PIFO, HPFQ can be implemented
using a tree of PIFOs. This ability to compose PIFOs together is powerful and allows us
to similarly express many hierarchical schedulers. Section 2.2 of the <a href="pifo-sigcomm.pdf">paper</a> has further details.
</p>

<dt><p>What can you express using PIFOs?</p></dt>
<dd>
<ol>
<li> Variants of priority scheduling (Earliest Deadline First, Least Attained Service, etc.)
<li> <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/wi01/cse222/papers/demers-fq-ire90.pdf">Weighted Fair Queueing</a>
<li> <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hzhang/papers/TON-97-Oct.pdf">Hierarchical Packet Fair
Queueing</a>
<li> Traffic shaping (maximum rate limits) in the form of token buckets
<li> Minimum rate limits on particular flows
</ol>
Section 2 and 3 of the <a href="pifo-sigcomm.pdf">paper</a> explain these and
other examples in greater detail.
</dd>

<dt><p>What can't you express?</p></dt>
<dd>
<p>
PIFOs can't express algorithms where dequeues from a particular flow are
limited to a specific maximum rate. While PIFOs can express a maximum flow rate
limit before packets are enqueued into a PIFO, they can't do so on the dequeue
side. Section 3.5 of the <a href="pifo-sigcomm.pdf">paper</a> explains
this.</p>
</dd>

<dt><p>How practical is a PIFO in hardware?</p></dt>
<dd>
<p>We implemented a PIFO in <a
href="https://github.com/programmable-scheduling/pifo-hardware/blob/master/src/rtl/design/pifo.v">Verilog</a>.
Our hardware design exploits the fact that most schedulers schedule across
flows, not packets. For these schedulers, a packet's priority in a PIFO increases
monotonically within a flow. Exploiting this fact, we sort only the head
packets of all flows, and store the remaining packets in a bank of first-in
first-out queues (FIFOs).
</p>

<p>Our hardware implementation is a sorted array of these head packets. An incoming
packet from a new flow is inserted in the right location by comparing its priority
in parallel to all head packets and then shifting the array to accomodate the new
packet. When the PIFO is dequeued, we shift out the top element of the array, fetch
the next packet of the just-dequeued flow from the bank of FIFOs, and then insert this
next packet into the array.
</p>

<p> Our current implementation supports 1024 flows within a PIFO that stores up
to 60000 elements. 5 such "PIFO blocks" can implement a 5-level hierarchical
scheduler and cost less than 4% in chip area. An ideal hardware implementation
would support as many flows as the number of PIFO elements: in the extreme,
each PIFO element belongs to a distinct flow. We can currently support up to
2048 flows, so we are still a ways off from 60000 elements/flows. However, we
think this can be optimized further.  </p>
